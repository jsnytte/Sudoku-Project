## Fork Repository Instructions
### Steps:
1. When you go to the github repository we provided, on the top right hand corner of the screen, there is a button that says "Fork". That will fork the repo to your own github 
2. Use the link https://github.com/new/import to clone your forked repo to make it private. You will work on the project by adding your own files to this private repository.

# Canvas Instructions

Your team will develop a Sudoku GUI application using object-oriented programming and event-driven programming.

# Guidelines
* **All deliverables are one per Group.**
* **Part 1: Report** [2 pts]
  * Your report can be a maximum of 4 pages long.
  * Your report must contain:
    * Team Name
    * Team Members' Names
    * Idea/Project Name
    * GitHub URL (See Part 2 for details)
    * Link to Video (if created, see Part 3 for details)
    * The name of the person who submitted sudoku_generator.py on Canvas.
    * Reflection [Suggested 1-1.5 Page]
      * Distribution of Responsibility and Roles: Who did what?
      * As a group, how was the overall experience for the project?
      * Did you have any challenges? If so, describe.
      * If you were to start once again as a group, any changes you would make to the project and/or workflow?
      * Comment on what each of the members learned through this process.
      * [Optional] Add URL references to any sources your group used through learning, development, or writing.
  * The font size must be at least 11 points.
  * The report file must be named Report_Group<group number>.pdf, e.g., Report_Group11.pdf
* **Part 2: Source Code** [5 pts]
  * Use GitHub to collaborate with your teammates and use a private repo to house all your source code.
  * Add the following TA/PM who will grade your project as a collaborator to your private GitHub repo.
* **Part 3: Project Showcase** [2 pts]
    * Your group will record a video showcasing all the features implemented in your game.
    * Your video should visually display all functionality outlined in the project's requirements. Thus, ensure you record gameplay rather than going over the source code.
    * The maximum time limit for the video is 5 minutes and *it will be strictly enforced*. You will lose 20% (0.4 pts) for each additional minute you use.
  * ***Submitting a Video:*** 
    * You will upload the video to YouTube and submit a URL in your report. Feel free to make it either public or **unlisted.**
    * You may record the video as a group or have a single member present.
    * You can use the recording software of your choice. We recommend Loom, Zoom, or QuickTime player on Mac.
* Note that each group will receive the same score/grade. However, if we observe issues in peer grading, there will be individual penalties from 20-100% of your project grade based on social loafing or not pulling your weight.
